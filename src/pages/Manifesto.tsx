            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              We live in an age where technology expands faster than ethics, and politics shrinks in the face of complexity. The old ideologies — capitalism without restraint, socialism without agility, democracy without expertise — no longer match the reality of a connected world.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              We, citizens of diverse origins and disciplines, establish this Manifesto to guide the creation of a sustainable, free, and intelligent society: The New Balance.

              The purpose of this movement is to promote a new social contract built on three integrated principles:

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-muted-foreground ml-4">
              <li>Open-Source Capitalism</li>

            </ul>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4">

              <li>Human dignity above all economic or political systems.</li>

              <li>The economy exists to serve humanity, not dominate it.</li>

              <li>Data and algorithms that influence public life must be open, auditable, and accountable.</li>
              <li>Monopoly power, whether corporate or institutional, undermines both freedom and progress.</li>

              <li>Democratic processes must be continuous and digital — allowing ongoing citizen input.</li>
              <li>Elected representatives serve under accountability clauses, including the right of recall.</li>
              <li>No surveillance law or system may override civil liberties or data protection.</li>

              The New Balance Association is a non-profit civic entity open to all individuals who accept this Manifesto. Its governance must reflect its principles: transparent, participatory, evidence-driven. Leadership is elected, recallable, and limited in term. Major decisions are subject to public consultation.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              We call upon engineers, economists, educators, artists, and citizens to join in building prototypes — not utopias. Every experiment counts. Every shared success becomes a proof of concept for a fairer system. Change begins not with protest, but with construction.

              We reject the false choice between efficiency and justice, freedom and equality, prosperity and sustainability. We stand for a civilization that chooses balance — dynamic, fair, intelligent.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              We pledge to build it openly, together, and without fear.
